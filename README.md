# Pico_1RU_maxtrix7219
Repo for my project of building a 1RU "blinky light bar" for a standard rack using a Raspberry Pico and 8x8 7219 matrix boards

Plenty of guides and setups on how to inialize a Pico.  All of this was done with Thonny (https://thonny.org/) and micropython.

The original lib for the matrix7219 is from  
https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-max7219  
I made some changes specifically for this project.  The original is still in the lib folder renamed to "original_max7219.py" 

Hardware used:
Matrix 7219 (8x8)

Raspberry Pico
I used both the Pico 2 and Pico Original - with the header pins pre-installed.  Cloned Picos work as well.
